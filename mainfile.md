so here's a file  
with some stuff in it  

let's make some branches  

# so this should be a conflict  resolved by adding both


# this line is added in the first-change branch  


## here's a change made on the third-change branch and we won't merge it into staging yet to see if we can make a conflict...resolved conflict 


and changes  
to see what git does.
